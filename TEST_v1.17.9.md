## Spin Helper v1.17.9 - Test Results and Changes Required


# General:
1. We need to be consistent with our non-editable readouts in all features. 'Current Wager X' is the current amount of bets placed; = (Spins completed * Bets/Spin Â£)
- Ensure the calulation for current wager in Spins, Clicker (Count and Automatic) are the same
- Ensure the display for current wager in Spins, Clicker (Count and Automatic) are the same and in the same position
- The hiarachy of the non-editable readouts should be consistent in all features and should be from top to bottom (stack on top); 'Spins Completed X' then 'Actual Clicks X' then 'Current Wager X'
- Do not use 'Current Wager X (Manual) in Automatic as i do not believe its any different from 'Current Wager X'.
2. in most games (see image attached as context) especially in the test game 'BIG BASS BONANZA' there is an area of the game, bottom middle, which displays whats going on. We could use this to help decide what the spinner is doing if the spinner detection is wondering 'whats going on'
3. We need to make sure that when we are 'grace clicking' or 'rescue clicking' (away from the spinner), that the app window for Spin Helper isnt what the mouse clicks. If it is a problem, then we can determine a solution, but for now i need you to confirm wether the grace clicks are required to have nothing 'on top' of the game/browser window in order to sucessfully perform a click.
4. Please add an 'infinite wait' toggle to the Environment section, so that if we have a spin button selected from its 'ready' state, we wait forever for it to return to 'ready' after its first clicked within Automatic or Slots.


# Clicker - Automatic [EDIT - NEW ISSUES] :
1. Please check the logic and ensure that the spin detector and the spins 'readiness' is the PRIMARY reason for the activation of clicks. This must be at the TOP of the hiearachy.
2. "Overlay-progress click (away from spin)" is moving the mouse into another monitor. Fix this, i would prefer we clicked in the same area as the spin button, but scrutinised that click to make sure it didn't cause the spin button to change states.
3. In the logs, snippet two, after a pause, i repositioned my mouse back onto the spinner reported 'Ready - automation started with target 125' but the target reset to 0. THIS MUST NOT HAPPEN as i was already through about 49 spins. We must make sure the spin count and actual click count is preserved through the session unless 'stop/reset' is clicked.
4. In the logs, snippet one, it doesn't appear that click 19 was completed, the count of clicks and spins were correct but i'm not certain it detected that 19 finished. This happened a few times on different spins when the 'win' animations were present. The app needs to wait effeciently and be certain the spin button is ready before deciding to increment the click/spin.

# Clicker - Counter:
1. not tested in this version.

# Slots (auto):
1. Failed during Free Spins overlay detection: See log. Spin 18 obtained 10 free spins but the app eventually just said 'initial_wait' but when it did the 'Overlay-progress click' the mouse clicked somewhere off screen away from the browser and lost focus which is when i had to rescue it and stopped it.
- We need to make this process more robust, by detecting a long delay in a spin completion so then holding that spin for potential free spins (which is automatic) but when the long delay is suspected, a small grace click (just slightly away from the spin button) is fine to clear the overlay and inact the Free Spins. Remember, sometimes during free spins automation, further free spins or 'win' animations can occur, increasing the period of time the spin button is in 'not ready', the app NEEDS TO WAIT and needs to keep checking the spin button for a return to 'ready' and therefore a completion of that spin (+ free spins + win animations etc).
