## Spin Helper v1.17.9-HOTFIX - Test Results and Changes Required


# Click / Slots / Universal:
1. [Test-Results] Current Wager layout: this is working ok. [PASSED]
2. [Test-Results] Status banner influence: *** On long WIN/free-spins, the pre-click phase should log that animations are active and wait (using status banner/slots/FS ROIs). ***
3. [Change] "Infinite wait after click" needs to be renamed (in the UI) to "Infinite Wait (Manual Mode)" to guide the user on using this setting to prevent timeouts and be partially involved in the process of monitoring spins and overlays (manually clicking).
4. [Remove] "System Information" from Environment Setup - can be removed/commented out so it does not display in the GUI for now. Keep current logging in terminal, add true/false statuses in terminal too for PIL, PyAutoGUI and Pynput.
5. [Add] Can we use the ROI functionality across all features to support the spin completion process/cycle?


# Clicker - Automatic:
1. [Test-Results] Automatic first click/resume: This seemed to work ok but I found two potential issues (see log below):
- after spin 6, there was a timeout at 21:05:59 which seemed to skip it's completion. I'm not sure if this was detrimental but following this an overlay progress click was performed at 21:06:06, which shot the mouse into my primary monitor, so i paused it. Then after this, i believe I clicked 'Ready' (I did not stop it, it was just paused) and i saw the Actual Clicks counter return to 0 while the Spin Completed stayed at 6, the app then tried to do spin 6 again (which is wrong as it had already done 6, but not received a completion) [FAILED] [NEEDSFIXING]
- note that i did not 'select ROI' for this run but the app continued fine thereafter and it could even detect a spin completion when my mouse was away from the spinner (i think this has nothing to do with the ROI?) [FAILED] [NEEDSFIXING]


2. [Test-Results] Actual Clicks vs Spins: See issue above. After timeout of spin 6, the app was paused, resumed by clicking Ready but the Actual Clicks started at 0 while the Spin Completed continued at 6-7. When i finally stopped the app the difference was Spins Completed: 18, Actual Clicks: 11. Which is very wrong. [FAILED] [NEEDSFIXING]

# Slots (auto):
1. [Test-Results] Overlay handling: Not fully tested. Did not use ROI for Slots, only used Automatic.
2. [Test-Results] Slots Target Calculator: Clicking 'Calculate' correctly calculates the values in the Slots Target Calculator, but also performs the action associated with the button 'Apply Target' to 'Target Spins X' and 'Total Wagering X' in Slot's Automation Controls display area (under the anti-idle toggle and settings). THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. The Calculation should show, in the calculator, first, then in order to apply this, the user MUST click 'Apply Target' for the 'Target Spins X' and 'Total Wagering X' to be updated in Slot's Automation Controls display area. This works as intended in Clicker>Automatic, so review there and replicate without breaking anything. [FAILED] [NEEDSFIXING]
