## Spin Helper v1.17.2

# Slots (auto) - Issues/fixes and suggestions:
1. 


# Clicker:
1. In Counter, clicking the mouse does not increase the count of 'Done' - clicking should increase this value.
2. In Automatic, if i set the target to a value, the go over to the tab Clicker and press 'Ready' it initiates the Automatic clicker. In-app focus and clicking 'Ready' or 'Start' in different parts of the app should reset and stop other parts of the app from running.
3. Stop should also RESET any targets or counters.
4. The buttons should be consistent in both Counter and Automatic;
    - Ready: places the mouse on the spin button, waits a grace period, then either asks the user to click (Counter) or starts the automatic clicking and SPIN DETECTION. Log this action.
    - Pause: tells the app that the user is no longer to be expected to click or for the app to do auto clicks. Pause the spin detection at next available 'ready' possition, after a full cycle. Log this action.
    - Stop/Reset: tells the app that this process is to be stopped, no further detection or action is required from the app. The counters and targets must be reset too (but DO NOT reset calculators, as it has it's down Reset). Log this action.

# Slots (auto):
1. The buttons should be consistent in Slots with other parts of the app;
    - Start: (does the same as 'Ready') places the mouse on the spin button, waits a grace period, then starts the automatic clicking and SPIN DETECTION. Log this action.
    - Pause: tells the app that the user is no longer to be expected to click or for the app to do auto clicks. Pause the spin detection at next available 'ready' possition, after a full cycle. Log this action.
    - Stop/Reset: tells the app that this process is to be stopped, no further detection or action is required from the app. The counters and targets must be reset too (but DO NOT reset calculators, as it has it's down Reset). Log this action.
2. This does not appear to be working. When i clicked on Start Auto Spins, the console logged out correctly but the mouse stayed where it was.
