## Spin Helper v1.17.3 - Test Results and Changes Required


# General:
1. Click Detection - im finding that on pressing 'ready' the mouse moves onto the Spinner area, great.. BUT i need an initial click to ensure the focus is on the browser window of the spinner/game in order for my click to be registered as a spin. Can we put something inplace that brings the browser into focus, such as a grace click some 15-25 px above the spin button (slightly outside of the range of motion the app uses to detect 'too much mouse movement' and pauses?)
2. Clicker Target Calculator within Automatic (not Counter) - the Current Wager is not useful here but SHOULD BE if we can use it more appropriately. If the user calcualtes using the Clicker Target Calc, then presses 'Apply Target', the Current Wager amount should show in the 'Automatic Click Controls' before the anti-idle waggle section. This should then increase basedo n the calculation and the number of spins done. ([Bet per spin] x [Current wager], i think?). Once Stop/Reset is pressed this Current Wager <value> can be reset.

# Clicker:
1. Counter - needs the adjustments as in General, point 1 above.
2. Automatic - appears to work very well, may need the above adjustment as it is using the 'rescue click' but without knowing what it's doing is 'focusing' on the browser so the following click is actually counted as the spin starting (and thus it sees the spinner going from read>not ready>ready)
3. 

# Slots (auto):
1. There is still a BIG ISSUE with the spin detection on this, is it not using the same spin detection as 'Clicker > Automatic' ??. It does not even try and make the first click to start the detection process. it positions the mouse, then does nothing. Even moving the mouse does not initiate a Pause.
