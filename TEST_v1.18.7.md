## Spin Helper v1.18.7 - Test Results and Changes Required


# Clicker - Automatic :
1. Overlay-progress click (away from spin): this is our main issue right now causing progress in a long spin count to be halted. See log below. It appears that the click isn't just happening away from the spin button, its happening all the way across the screen. This needs to be refactored so if we need to do a click, we can do it on the spin button, but we need to be checking we haven't hijacked the current spin (if there is one going) and we avoid counting the click unless it affects the completion of a new spin for example
- if we're on spin 145, and we're awaiting it to be ready again, theres a completion timeout, check the spin button for visual readiness but don't click, if its ready, assume the last spin completed but always be checking the slots for on-going animations (and log this out to the user).
- if the spin button is not ready, theres a timeout, check slots area for animations but don't click. if the spin button is 'not ready' then we can click the spin button to clear animations/overlays but it MUST NOT affect or cause the spin button to spin again, but be ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN the spin button is NOT READY and 'DOING A SPIN' before we perform any grace clicks for overlay hurry.
2. We need clearer logging;
- Like in previous versions, ensure we log when the app sees the button as 'ready', 'not ready' (spinning) and 'ready' (button returned, spin done). Include spin completions in miliseconds. Make sure this is clear in the log and the only thing that is coloured (everything else can be white) but 'Ready' is yellow, a 'not ready' when spin os occuring is amber and back to ready, once spin is complete should be bright green.
- Include debug logging (that can help you and me)
