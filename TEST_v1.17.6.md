1. During a test of 100 spins, a Free Spin overlay was encountered but the application did not detect despite the Free-Spins Overlay being set. I note that the free spin occured within spin 26 and the app detected 'no visual change' to the button, which was correct, but failed to suspect an overlay was showing.
- Note that in Big Bass Bonanza (this might be game specific, but most games have win animations that take ages) the free spins overlay (see image in chat) can be 'skipped' by a click anywhere on the screen. We should attempt to do this, much like how we click a certain px away from the spin button to focus the browser. We need to do this rather than doing a rescue click on the spin button (which may cause a faux spin that isn't recorded). So, if no change in button for a period of over 3.5 seconds, click 'anywhere' (away from spin button but either above or to the left of it - towards the slots.. which is the centre of the screen if we can detemrine that?), then wait, then check the spin button readiness, then click 'anywhere' again, then wait and check the spin button readiness again. If nothing, check the slots area for 'win' animations, then cycle this process again another 2-3 times before timing out/giving up.
- If we can do the above, maybe we can repurpose the Free-Spins Detection to be a selection over the slots, where we can check for these win animations and overlays.
- Note that with Free Spins, when the overlay is cleared (by the above process if built), the Free Spins carry on by themselves, so the button will stay 'not ready' until they are complete, make sure the app does not panic and timeout during this time (which is probably why we need to detect "FREE SPINS LEFT X"?) and until a final overlay is shown (e.g. 'well done, you won X')
- Screenshot is attached to the Codex chat with this file as context.
